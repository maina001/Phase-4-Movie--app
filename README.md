# Phase-4-Movie--app
#DESCRIPTION
A movie voting app created with React is be a web application that allows users to vote on their favorite movies, view movie details and ratings, and browse through a library of movies.

The main features of this app would include a homepage that displays the latest movies, user login and registration,  and a movie details page that shows the movie's synopsis, cast and crew, and user ratings.

The app would also feature a recommendation engine, which would suggest movies to users based on their previous ratings and viewing history. The recommendation engine would use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate personalized recommendations.

The app would be created using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It would use a RESTful API to communicate with a backend server that would handle authentication, data storage, and recommendation generation. The app's user interface would be designed using CSS and styled components, and it would be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
